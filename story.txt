Annie went to a mall. She was going there to buy new shoes. She couldn't find any of her size so she left unhappy and cried.
	
When she reached home, her mother saw her crying. Because she could not see her daughter cry any longer, she decided to take her to the mall two hours away from their house. Even there they failed to find the shoes and were confused if they should go further to another mall or just go home.

Annie started to cry again. Her mother totally had no idea, so she called her husband. Annie's father worked in another city, he said he would go to the store nearby to find if there got Annie's size. Buthe didn't know what kind of shoes Annie wanted.

Everyone finally decided to give up and go home. But while going home, Annie's father found the shoes in a nearby shoestore, and went to buy them. Now Annie has her shoes, and everyone is happy.
