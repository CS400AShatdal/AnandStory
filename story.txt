Annie went to a mall. She was going there to buy new shoes. She couldn't find any of her size so she left unhappy and cried.
	
When she reached home, her mother saw her crying. Because she could not see her daughter cry any longer, she decided to take her to the mall two hours away from their house. Even there they failed to find the shoes and were confused if they should go further to another mall or just go home.
